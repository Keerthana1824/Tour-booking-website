# Tour Booking Website

## Overview

This project is a Tour Booking Website created to develop and enhance my frontend skills using React and Material UI. The website showcases various travel spots as grids using the Paper component. When a Paper component is clicked, it navigates to a blog page about the tour booking agency, allowing users to book travel. It also includes a calendar to fix dates and a collage of images in scroll mode for a rich visual experience.
